# ?, where

`?` or `where` can be used to add a color and animation to an element to easier see where it is or if it's actually visible. It can only be used in a development environment.

`envMode` in the config can be used to set the environment. Default is `build` but it can also be set to `dev` to make `?` and `where` work.

:::info
`envMode` does not work in the runtime. Click the link in the preview to see the final result.
