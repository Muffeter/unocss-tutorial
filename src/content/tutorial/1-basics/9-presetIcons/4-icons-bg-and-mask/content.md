# ?bg and ?mask

In presetIcons icons are either rendered as icons with several colors or a single color. By default this is autodetected so icons look like they should. It is possible to override this autodetection by adding `?bg` to make it a multi color icon or `?mask` to make it a single color icon.

Try copying the `<div>` row and adding `?mask` and `text-red-300` to the end.
